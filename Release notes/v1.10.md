## Bases

This release introduces tons of new features and improvements to Bases. This release also includes the initial version of the Bases API.

### New

- Added "Group by" to group your data by the given property. Available in the "Sort menu."
- Added table summaries. To use use them, right-click a table column and choose "Summarize...". Choose from the list of built-in summary functions, or write your own.
- New List view lets you display files as bulleted lists and numbered lists. Supports multi-line content and nested properties.
- Initial [Bases API](<https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/commit/359ffc30309077aa45954b9203fd30e5ac3da837>).
- New Maps plugin lets you visualize your base entries on a map. Install it from the Community plugins directory. This is an [official open source plugin](<https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-maps>) that also provides an example of how developers can implement new view types for Bases.
- New table selection.
- Full keyboard navigation. Full list of hotkeys [here](<#table-hotkeys>).
- Copy/paste support.
- Basic edit history (undo and redo) via `Cmd/Ctrl-Z` and `Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-Z`.

### Improvements

- Added `reduce()` function for lists.
- Added new `html()` function for rendering custom HTML.
- Add new `random()` function. Useful if you want to create a custom formula for randomizing your sort order.
- Add support for timezone offset in ISO 8601 datetime parsing.
- View will periodically refresh the results of `file.backlinks` and other formulas that result in stale data.
- Clicking the ribbon item with modifier keys opens the file in a new tab (`Ctrl/Cmd`), a new split (`Ctrl/Cmd-Shift`), or a new window (`Ctrl/Cmd-Alt-Shift`).
- Indeterminate checkboxes (where the value is `null`) are now sorted with `false` values.
- Improved behavior of "New item" file creation. Improved property value inference.
- "Change view" command has been renamed to "Switch view..."

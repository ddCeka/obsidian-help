## No longer broken

- Desktop: Fixed an issue where pop-out windows would not reopen after quitting the app.
- Bases: `file.hasTag('#tag')` is no longer case-sensitive. `file.hasTag('test')` and `file.hasTag('TEST')` now return the same results.
- Bases: The `contains` function now correctly handles [nested tags](<https://help.obsidian.md/tags#Nested+tags>).  For example,`tags.contains("A")` will now return results containing `#A` as well as `#A/B`.
- Bases: Formulas using `this` now work if a Base file is embedded inside Canvas.
- Bases: Formulas using `this` now resolve to null if the Base is not in the sidebar and not embedded.
